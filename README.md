Built a fully responsive Spotify Clone using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to replicate the design and core functionalities of the original music streaming platform. The project offers an intuitive and engaging user interface, optimized for seamless interaction across multiple devices. Through dynamic use of JavaScript, users can enjoy features like song playback, album browsing, and playlist creation, all within a visually appealing and interactive design.

By leveraging responsive CSS techniques, such as media queries and flexible layouts, the application ensures a consistent and adaptive user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. The clone effectively demonstrates mastery of front-end technologies and highlights the ability to create fluid, user-centered web applications with real-world utility.
